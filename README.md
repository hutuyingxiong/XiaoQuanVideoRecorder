## Dependency
You should download the latest source code of [GPUImage](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage) and compile it to a framework named as GPUImage4iOS.framework, and replace the old one.
## Notes
You should run the demo project on real ios device rather than simulator, as the GPUImage does not support simulator.
